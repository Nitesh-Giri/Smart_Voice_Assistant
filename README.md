Speech-to-Todo List App
A React-based web application that converts spoken tasks into a manageable todo list with features like updating, deleting, and adding tasks to your calendar.

Features
Speech Recognition:
Uses the Web Speech API to transcribe spoken words in real-time.
Continuously listens and updates the transcript as you speak.
Task Extraction:
Automatically extracts tasks from spoken text based on date references (e.g., "on Friday", "next week", "the fifth of April").
Cleans up the text to remove filler words (e.g., "okay", "well") and normalize phrases (e.g., "some grocery" to "groceries").
Todo List Management:
Display: Shows tasks in a clean list with checkmarks.
Update: Edit any task inline with a text input and save or cancel changes.
Delete: Remove tasks with a single click.
Add to Calendar:
Generate and download an .ics file for each task, which can be imported into calendar apps like Google Calendar or Outlook.
Parses dates and times from task text (e.g., "on Monday at 2:00 p.m.") to set event details.
Prerequisites
Node.js: Version 14.x or higher.
npm: Comes with Node.js, version 6.x or higher.
A modern web browser (Chrome recommended, as it fully supports the Web Speech API).
Installation and Running the Project
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

Clone the Repository:
bash
Wrap
Copy
git clone <repository-url>
cd speech-to-todo-list
Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL if hosted on GitHub or another platform.
Install Dependencies:
bash
Wrap
Copy
npm install
This installs React and other necessary packages (assumes you have a package.json with react, react-dom, etc.).
Run the Development Server:
bash
Wrap
Copy
npm start
This starts the app using react-scripts (assuming a Create React App setup). The app will open at http://localhost:3000 in your default browser.
Grant Microphone Access:
When prompted by the browser, allow microphone access for speech recognition to work.
Usage:
Click "Start Listening" to begin transcribing speech.
Speak tasks naturally (e.g., "I need to buy groceries on Friday").
Use the buttons next to each task to update, delete, or add to your calendar.

Description: The app before starting speech recognition, showing the "Start Listening" button.

2. Listening and Transcribing

Description: The app actively listening, displaying the transcript in the "Listening Area".

3. Todo List with Tasks

Description: The todo list populated with tasks, showing "Update", "Delete", and "Add to Calendar" buttons.

4. Editing a Task

Description: A task being edited with the input field and "Save"/"Cancel" buttons.

5. Calendar File Download

Description: Browser prompt to download an .ics file after clicking "Add to Calendar".

Example Usage
Input Speech:

text
Wrap
Copy
okay well I need to remember to buy some grocery on Friday I have a meeting with a team on Monday at 2:00 p.m. also don't forget my sister birthday is on the fifth of April will need to plan something last I need deliver the project to the client by next week
Resulting Todo List:

text
Wrap
Copy
✔️ I need to remember to buy groceries on Friday         [Update] [Delete] [Add to Calendar]
✔️ I have a meeting with a team on Monday at 2:00 p.m.   [Update] [Delete] [Add to Calendar]
✔️ Don't forget my sister birthday is on the fifth of April  [Update] [Delete] [Add to Calendar]
✔️ I need to deliver the project to the client by next week  [Update] [Delete] [Add to Calendar]
Click "Update" to edit a task, e.g., change "buy groceries" to "buy vegetables".
Click "Delete" to remove a task.
Click "Add to Calendar" to download an .ics file for a task, then open it to add to your calendar.
Limitations
Speech Recognition: Requires browser support (works best in Chrome) and a quiet environment for accurate transcription.
Date Parsing: Basic parsing may misinterpret complex or ambiguous dates. Assumes current year for specific dates (e.g., "the fifth of April" becomes April 5, 2025).
Continuous Updates: Speech recognition overwrites the todo list with each update, potentially discarding manual edits.
Future Improvements
Integrate a more robust NLP library (e.g., compromise) for better task extraction.
Add a date/time picker for manual calendar event adjustments.
Persist tasks using local storage or a backend database.
Support direct calendar API integration (e.g., Google Calendar) instead of .ics downloads.

Steps to Add Screenshots
Run the app locally (npm start).
Take screenshots at different stages:
Initial screen (before clicking "Start Listening").
While listening (with transcript visible).
Todo list with tasks and buttons.
Editing a task (after clicking "Update").
Browser download prompt (after clicking "Add to Calendar").
Save them in a screenshots/ folder in your project directory (e.g., screenshots/initial-screen.png).
Update the README.md screenshot paths to match your file names.
Additional Setup Notes
If you haven’t set up the project with Create React App yet:

Run npx create-react-app speech-to-todo-list to initialize it.
Replace the default src/App.js with the provided code.
Add Tailwind CSS to public/index.html:
html
Wrap
Copy
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
Ensure your package.json includes:
json
Wrap
Copy
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build"
}
